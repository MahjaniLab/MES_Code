Moderate effect size genes project
Author: Madison Caballero

Folder descriptions:
1_MES_screen: Code and files related to the initial screen of MES genes (Figure 2 Steps 1-4). Individual-level data is not included.

2_MES_non_neuro : Code/commands for extracting deleterious variants in the three non-neuro cohorts. This folder includes code
    for the equilibrium test.

3_MES_synonymous : Combination of code and files for the equivalence of 1_MES_screen and 2_MES_non_neuro for synonymous variants. Only
    code with changes are included. Other code and commands are otherwise unchanged.

4_Expression : Code and results for gene expression analyses. 

5_Phenotypes : Code and results for phenotype analyses.
